# Machine Learning with Iris Dataset
Iris dataset is a classic dataset for data visualization, classification and machine learning. The Iris dataset is a multivariate dataset. It consists of 50 samples from each of three species (Virginica, Setosa and Versicolor) of Iris flower and four numeric attributes(independent variable) are Sepal length, Petal length, Sepal width and Petal width. One flower species is linearly separable from the other two, but the other two are not linearly separable from each other.

Predict attribute: Predict the class(species)of the flower based on available attributes.
# Purpose
To gain knowledge of classification concept along with data visualization. For this purpose, we are using scikit-learn, pandas, seaborn libraries.
