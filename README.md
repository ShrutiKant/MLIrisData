# Machine Learning with Iris Dataset
Iris dataset is a classic dataset for data visualization, classification and machine learning. The Iris dataset is a multivariate dataset. It consists of 50 samples from each of three species (Virginica, Setosa and Versicolor) of Iris flower and four numeric attributes(independent variable) are Sepal length, Petal length, Sepal width and Petal width. One flower species is linearly separable from the other two, but the other two are not linearly separable from each other.

Predict attribute: Predict the class(species)of the flower based on available attributes.
# Purpose
To gain knowledge of classification concept along with data visualization. For this purpose, we are using scikit-learn, pandas, seaborn libraries. 
# Analysis
1. In data visualization step, the features are graphed in a pair plot, from this it is clear that the relationship between pairs of features of a iris-setosa is distinctly different from those of the other two species for plots envolving Petal width and Petal length.
2. There is some overlap in the pairwise relationships of the other two species, iris-versicolor and iris-virginica. For the plots involving Sepal Length and Width, there seems to be a lot of overlap.
